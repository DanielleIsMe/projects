            <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
            <img src="images/cssRelativeExample.jpg" class="paragraphImgRight">
            <p>It's possible to position an element on a webpage relative to it's original position.
                We can change the position of an element using the "position" property. when we set the elements position
                to relative, we change an elements position in relation to it's <strong class="relativeExample">Original</strong> position using 
                normal flow!</p>
            <img src="images/cssRelativeRaiseExample.jpg" class="paragraphImgRight">
            <p>We can <strong class="raise">raise</strong> the element 10px up from it's original position by using the bottom property.
            We can also move an element in this way by using the top, right and left properties after defining it's position!</p>
            <p> coding left means we push the element away from the left of it's relative position, right from the right, top from
                the top and bottom from the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>See the gap where "raise" used to be? relative position doesn't change normal flow, so other elements act like it's still there!

            <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
            <img src="images/cssAbsoluteExample.jpg" class="paragraphImgRight">
            <p>We can also position elements based on the edges of a webpage using the position property. To place an element on a specific spot 
            on the screen, we start by setting it's position property to "absolute."</p>
            <img src="images/cssAbsoluteExampleImg.jpg" class="paragraphImgRight">
            <p>If we want to put an image on the left of the webpage, we use left: 0px;. this means that the image will be 0px away from the left
            of the webpage no matter what. Just like relative positioning we can use top, bottom, right and left, to instead position an element 
            an exact distance away from the edge of the webpage.</p>
            <img src="images/zIndexExample.jpg" class="paragraphImgRight">
            <p>Setting an element's position to absolute removes it from the Normal Flow, which can cause it to overlap other elements on a webpage.  Luckily for us, there is a way to control overlapping elements: a property called z-index.</p>
            <p>Z-index controls how far into the foreground or background an element is. by default, all elements on a webpage have the default z-index value of 0.  To place an element in front of another, we set the z-index to a higher number like 1.  any whole number works</p>
            <p>Elements with a higher z-index number are always in front.</p>
