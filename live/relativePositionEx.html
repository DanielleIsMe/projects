            <p>It's possible to position an element on a webpage relative to it's original position.
                We can change the position of an element using the "position" property. when we set the elements position
                to relative, we change an elements position in relation to it's <strong class="relativeExample">Original</strong> position using 
                normal flow!</p>
            <img src="images/cssRelativeRaiseExample.jpg" class="paragraphImgRight">
            <p>We can <strong class="raise">raise</strong> the element 10px up from it's original position by using the bottom property.
            We can also move an element in this way by using the top, right and left properties after defining it's position!</p>
            <p class="second"> coding left means we push the element away from the left of it's relative position, right from the right, top from
                the top and bottom from the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>See the gap where "raise" used to be? relative position doesn't change normal flow, so other elements act like it's still there!
